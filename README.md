My favorite hobby is dance. Dance has been apart of my life throughout all 13 years I have been living. Dance helps me express my emotions when words cannot. Dance is art and it makes me happy knowing I am able to make art. Dance is not only fun but also a good way to get rid of stress. Once I am on the dance floor, I forget about all my issues and problems. Dance brings me into another world where there is no problems besides getting better. Dancing is about improvement, there is always going to be someone better than you, but you will always be better than someone else. Throughout this sport, you must stay motivated. The second you lose motivation is the second you lose your abilities. Dance needs constant practice, it needs determination and strength, without it you won't be a good, graceful, and strong dancer.
